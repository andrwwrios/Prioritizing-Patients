# Prioritizing-Patients
For this assignment we were asked to write a program that asks a medical worker to input some information about the hospital and patient in question, and then it will use that 
information to assign that patient a priority score. A higher priority score indicates the patient should be treated as high priority and seen sooner than other patients who have 
lower priority scores. 
Note: The algorithm that I am going to implement is flawed and does not treat all patients equitably. This is done purposefully because there are many similarly-flawed systems in 
place in our society, and their results affect real people.
